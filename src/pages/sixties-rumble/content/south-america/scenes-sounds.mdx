This is where it gets juicy.

### Brazil
Bossa nova (or what i’d like to call OG Lo-fi music to study to) exploded out of Rio’s apartments and beaches — João Gilberto, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Astrud Gilberto — smooth, jazzy, cosmopolitan. Later in the decade, Brazil’s Tropicalia movement (Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Os Mutantes) mashed rock, psychedelia, and Brazilian folk into a technicolor protest soundtrack. MPB – Música Popular Brasileira: a broad label for sophisticated, locally rooted “serious pop.” Jazz chords, samba swing, poetic lyrics.
    
### Colombia
Cumbia went global. By the late 60s, it was traveling via records and radio, becoming a cultural export as much as a local favorite. Accordion-heavy vallenato also rose up, giving Colombia its second great pop sound.
    
### Chile, Argentina, Uruguay
Folk revival with teeth. Nueva Canción took rural folk instruments and used them to sing about poverty, inequality, and resistance — Violeta Parra, Mercedes Sosa, Victor Jara. Music here became a revolutionary weapon.
    
### Peru
Rock ’n’ roll got a tropical twist. Bands like Los Saicos arguably invented proto-punk with their raw, chaotic sound. Meanwhile, Peruvian cumbia (aka chicha) began blending Andean melodies with electric guitars.
