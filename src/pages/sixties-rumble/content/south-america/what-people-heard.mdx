Before rock ’n’ roll truly arrived, the continent was already grooving hard. Each country had deep folk traditions: Andean flutes, Afro-Caribbean percussion, Amazonian chants, gaucho guitar ballads — all feeding into urban life. In Colombia, cumbia (born from Indigenous, African, and Spanish roots) was already the people’s soundtrack. In Brazil, samba had long reigned supreme, morphing into a slicker, lounge-friendly cousin: bossa nova. Argentina held onto tango but was also sneaking jazz into cafés. Basically, the continent had no shortage of rhythm.
