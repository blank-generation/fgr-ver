The real game-changer? The electric guitar. Cheap imports flooded cities and made kids dream of forming bands. Add transistor radios, which carried global sounds into barrios and favelas, and vinyl records becoming more accessible. Studios were still relatively modest, but the fusion of folk instruments (charango, quena, bandoneón, cuíca) with modern kit (electric bass, Hammond organs, drum kits) created brand new soundscapes.
