        With Focus group soundsystem, the intention was to bring the spirit of
        FGR to dance floors to make it an interactive experience between
        selectors, the music and the audience. After a few shows putting our
        ideas together, playing for almost 10,000 people at covelong classic
        music festival, and taking the soundsystem very successfully outside our
        home turf, we are ready to take this across the entire galaxy.

        Focus Group Sound System brings this spirit to a live gig by playing
        open to close sets normally about 4.5 hours. Over the Course of the
        night, they delve neck deep into its theme by exploring music from the
        last five decades that isn’t traditionally built for the dance floors
        along with contemporary dance music that is considerably
        under-represented in India. Using this format and spirit as inspiration,
        We launched our first IP - “African Music Exploration”. The night starts
        with playing old jazz and funk records from Ethi- opia, Nigeria,
        Senegal, Ghana and Cameroon slowly progressing into afro disco records.
        When it comes to filling the dance floors with contemporary dance music
        that is under-represented in the scene, broken African rhythms from
        GQOM, Kuduro, SOCA, Singeli, Dembow, Dancehall are weaved in together
        with constant twists and turns.
      </p>
      <p class="para mt-8">
        What sets us apart is our love for open-to-close sets, where we delve
        neck deep into a theme or region, crafting a musical journey that lasts
        for about 4 to 5 hours. It's during these extended performances that we
        can truly explore the essence of a particular genre or era, captivating
        the audience from start to finish.
      </p>
      <p class="para mt-8">
        In the near future, our aim is to elevate our soundsystem experience by
        merging it with new media, art, and tech. This fusion will create a
        multidimensional gig where captivating visual projections and
        interactive elements complement the music's theme.
      </p>
      <p class="para mt-8 mb-20">
        With the live gigs, the hope is to build a community of selectors across
        the country and provide a safe space for them to confidently bring a
        range of weird and wonderful music to a dancefloor that loves to
        discover new music
