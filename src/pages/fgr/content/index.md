title: Focus group radio or FGR (as it's commonly known) started during the
  lockdowns as a weekly online radio program dubbed 'listening parties'. It has
  since grown into a rather diverse group; some musicians, some artists, all
  bonafide music nerds. Fgr captured and connected folks across the world,
  united by a singular purpose - discovering great new music.

para1: The radio embodied the spirit of the infamous pirate radios from 90s uk.
  These shows were accompanied by a chatroom on discord where the listeners can
  nerd out on the music and the context around it. As the community grew, we
  found a cache of music nerds across the country that had an appetite to
  consume new and unexplored sounds. <br /> after the lockdowns were lifted, we
  took these radio shows from the virtual realm to the real world, while
  remaining true to our ethos of honest exploration and thematic cohesion. We
  hosted multiple 'live radio' shows at local clubs, filled with carefully
  curated music that defied the typical club scene. From the rhythmic african
  sounds of fela kuti to delving into the avant-garde no wave scene of 80s new
  york, we provided a refreshing and eclectic experience for our audience.
para2: Additionally, we ventured into the realm of art and tech by collaborating
  with altermodern artists "television dust". The visual installation were made
  using footage from phone cameras and manipulating them with code in real-time.
  We explored this side further by handing out beautifully designed zines,
  posters, pamphlets, and stickers, courtesy of our talented design duo - meld.
  <br /> fgr's biggest asset is exploratory spirit that would rival most 15th
  century sea captains, but the real secret is, the artists we work with -
  specifically our favourite - the aforementioned graphic design duo meld who
  have been with us in our journey of exploring the weird and wonderful and have
  been the main driving force of everything aesthetics and design for anything
  that comes from focus group radio. "
para3: Focus group radio embodies that rebellious diy spirit, exploring the
  space between the unconventional and the wonderfully weird, while embracing
  everything in between. Over three years, we've built a like-minded community
  through radio sessions, live gigs, and diverse music and art curation.
  Together, we will continue our quest to appreciate and delve into all things
  peculiar and leftfield within the realms of music, art, and culture.
